//Using Java, write a function called FizzBuzz which prints the numbers from 1 to 100.  
Function specifications:
**
 * This program plays the game "Fizzbuzz".  It counts to 100, replacing each
 * multiple of 5 with the word "fizz", each multiple of 7 with the word "buzz",
 * and each multiple of both with the word "fizzbuzz".  It uses the modulo
 * operator (%) to determine if a number is divisible by another.
